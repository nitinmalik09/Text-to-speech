# Text-to-speech
Project that helps to convert text to speech. This project is a PDF to Audiobook Converter that extracts text from a PDF file and converts it into an audio file using text-to-speech technology. It uses the PyPDF2 library to read and extract text from the PDF and the gTTS library to convert the text into speech. The resulting audio file is saved in .wav format, enabling users to listen to their documents as audiobooks. This tool is useful for enhancing accessibility and making reading more convenient.
# Usage
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 Audiobook.py <filename.pdf>
# Future Works
1.	Support for Multiple Languages:
Add a feature to automatically detect the language of the PDF and convert the text to speech in the same language.
	2.	Enhanced Text Cleaning:
Improve text preprocessing by handling special characters, headers, footers, and unnecessary formatting for cleaner audio output.
	3.	Audio Customization:
Allow users to adjust the speech speed, pitch, and voice (male/female) using libraries like pyttsx3.
	4.	PDF Metadata Extraction:
Extract and include metadata (e.g., title, author) in the audio fileâ€™s tags for better organization.
	5.	Partial Conversion:
Enable users to specify page ranges or sections of the PDF for conversion instead of processing the entire file.
	6.	Multiple Output Formats:
Allow audio to be saved in various formats like .mp3 or .aac in addition to .wav.
	7.	Mobile/Desktop App Integration:
Develop a user-friendly GUI for desktop or a mobile app for easier interaction with the tool.
	8.	Cloud Storage Integration:
Add support for uploading PDFs and saving audio files to cloud services like Google Drive or Dropbox.
	9.	Real-Time Text-to-Audio Streaming:
Implement real-time streaming for converting and playing text as audio without saving the file.
	10.	AI Voice Integration:
Use advanced AI voice models like those from Amazon Polly or Google Cloud Text-to-Speech for more natural-sounding audio.
	11.	Summarization Before Conversion:
Integrate a text summarization feature using NLP techniques to convert only the key points into audio.
	12.	Accessibility Features:
Add features like screen reader compatibility or braille support to make the tool more inclusive for visually impaired users.
